1. Download MSSQL Server with tools
2. Set it up with the instructions from the PDF document
3. Create a database
4. Change all occurrences of the connection string to

5. Run the SQL scripts one by one in order in an SQL query editor in SQL server management studio
6. Populate the tables with the data in the Excel sheets
